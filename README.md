This application provides the means to monitor and document the strict adherence of volunteer or assigned cleaners to the specific, location-based cleaning guidelines.
These guidelines are also created by selected knowledgeable individuals specializing in sustainable cleaning methods, with a distinct set developed for each cleaning spot.
Volunteer or assigned personnel will receive the maximum allocated stipend upon demonstrating strict adherence to all location-specific cleaning protocols.

The project is dedicated to sustainable land restoration, environmental sanitation, and the reduction of soil-borne microplastics.
The project also plays a role in dismantling the societal stigma that classifies cleaning as a menial task or one reserved for certain social groups, thereby promoting greater respect for this essential work.
